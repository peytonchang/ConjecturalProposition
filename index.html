    <div class="content">
        <h2>As a parent of a computer science student, you understand the importance of staying ahead in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.</h2>
        <h3>Here's why we need to support the integration of <span class="tooltip">AI<span class="tooltiptext">Artificial Intelligence: The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.</span></span> tools in our classrooms.</h3>
        <p>The current ban on AI tools is hindering our students' ability to compete and innovate in a technology-driven world. This newsletter is dedicated to raising awareness among parents and advocating for change.</p>
        <p>The current restriction on the use of AI tools in computer science education stemmed from concerns over privacy, ethical implications, and the fear of creating a dependency on technology that might hinder fundamental learning processes.</p>
        <p>Currently, the Computer Science department at the University of Maryland enforces a strict "no ai" policy in all of its classes. Furthermore, in the entire CS track, only one course about artificial intelligence is avaible while schools such as UPenn and Johns Hopkins offer AI majors. It is important that the University takes proactive steps to prepare students to enter the work force.</p>
        <p>Statistics:</p>
        <p> - LinkedIn's 2020 Emerging Jobs Report ranks "Artificial Intelligence Specialist" as the job with the highest annual growth rate, with a 74% annual increase in job postings.</p>
        <p> - According to a report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market size was valued at approximately $93.5 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.1% from 2022 to 2030.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Key Benefits:</span> Incorporating AI tools into computer science education can dramatically improve learning outcomes and prepare students for future challenges.</p>
